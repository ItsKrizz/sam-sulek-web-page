            <h1>Sam Sulek Workout</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Sam Sulek has quite a good understanding of resistance training and bodybuilding methods in spite of being relatively young. His training routine varies greatly from time to time depending upon the goals and personal preferences. His splits can vary from bro splits (back, chest, arms, shoulders, legs and abs) to more functional training splits like push, pull and leg training.</p>
            
            <p>Sulek believes in consistency and does not like taking too many days off from training. He also thinks that formulating a training plan that best suits one’s preferences is the best way to maintain consistency in training. While explaining his process to formulate training plan, Sulek once said:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“A lot of the time I think that the reason that you may get tired of training is just because of your split or workouts or whatever… They’re not really tailored to your own personal needs.”</p>
                <p>“I always like the fact that I am coming up with my stuff because then it just lets me sort of adjust my workouts and my rep schemes and my styles and whatever to what I know is going to feel good and give me results.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Sulek’s approach to progress is more instinctive than calculated. He does not seem to track the progress by keeping a log of his exercises. He primarily resorts to low volume high intensity training aimed at gaining strength and muscle mass.</p>

                <h2>Training Routine for Bulk</h2>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Push Day Workout</h3>
            <p>Sam Sulek’s push workout for bulking is a mix of presses, flyes, pulls and lateral raise movements. He does not have a dedicated exercise for anterior delts as the muscle gets activated through most incline pressing movements. Sulek gives a lot of importance to warming up the rotator cuffs and elbow joints to get the most out of his compound pressing exercises.</p>

            <p>Therefore he starts the push day session with unilateral variation of triceps pushdowns and cable face pulls. He then follows it up with compound pressing exercises and delt-specific movements to work the chest and shoulder muscles.</p>

            <p>He innovates and adapts the exercises to benefit from them in the most effective way possible. One example is the lying face pull where Sulek uses the bench and does the exercise from a lying position. This helps him focus on posterior deltoid muscles without having to worry about the angle, standing posture etc.</p>

            <p>Sam Sulek’s push day for bulking is composed of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Single Arm Triceps Pushdown</li>
                <li>Single Arm Cable Face Pulls</li>
                <li>Incline Barbell Press</li>
                <li>Bent Over Cable Chest Flyes</li>
                <li>Pec Deck Flyes</li>
                <li>Lying Face Pulls</li>
                <li>Machine Lateral Raises</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Pull Day Workout</h3>
            <p>Sam Sulek keeps things ridiculously simple when it comes to the pull day. He warms up with one arm pullovers and low rows to get a good warm-up to the forearms, biceps, shoulders and back. He does not count this as a part of the main workout which consists of a handful of vertical and horizontal pulling movements. This highly effective combination helps him build a wide and thick back.</p>

            <p>The pull day typically consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One Arm Chest Supported Rows</li>
                <li>Iso-Lateral Lat Pulldowns</li>
                <li>Machine Seated Rows</li>
                <li>Reverse Grip Lat Pulldown</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Leg Day – Quads, Hamstrings and Triceps</h3>
            <p>Sulek’s leg day in the bulking season is quite unusual. While most experts would recommend incorporating a variety of compound isolation exercises in the training routine to build muscle, functional strength and also strengthen the supporting muscles, what Sulek does is entirely opposite.</p>

            <p>He splits the leg day in two separate training sessions. The quad day includes one exercise – leg extensions – performed until failure for over ten total sets. Sulek follows a similar pattern for hamstrings as well and executes quite a few sets of lying leg curls to fire up the hamstrings.</p>

            <p>The 21-year-old clubs the hamstrings day with triceps training, performing three different exercises to work the muscles from different angles and positions.</p>
